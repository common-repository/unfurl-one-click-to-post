== Description ==

**Make new post from a link in one click, like on Twitter**

Post content from an external publication with one click: Insert link to the input field in WordPress dashboard and a new post will be created.

It is similar to twitter cards - title, description and featured image is taken from metadata if there are any. The featured image gets downloaded into your own media library and set as a regular featured image.

1. The image/title from the site does not render, I get a default one.

This happens currently mainly for medium.com articles. This plugin is still under development - the internets are wild and the metatags aren't perfect.
